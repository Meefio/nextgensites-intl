## Blog Components

### SummaryBox Component

The SummaryBox component is used to display a summary of the most important points in your article. It's typically placed at the beginning of the article so readers can quickly understand what to expect.

You can use it as follows:

```jsx
<SummaryBox>
- First point
- Second point
- Third point
</SummaryBox>
```

### WorthKnowingBox Component

The WorthKnowingBox is used to highlight important information that the reader should remember. It's an ideal place to put key facts, tips, or warnings.

<WorthKnowingBox>
The WorthKnowingBox component can also be automatically filled with information from the frontmatter if you define a `worthKnowing` field in your article metadata.
</WorthKnowingBox>

### NextArticleBox Component

The NextArticleBox is used to link to related articles. It's a great way to encourage readers to explore more content on your site.

## Text Formatting

### Bullet Lists

* First point
* Second point
  * Sub-point A
  * Sub-point B
* Third point

### Numbered Lists

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Code

You can insert code blocks as follows:

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("This is an example code");
  return true;
}
```

Or insert `inline code` in your text.

### Quotes

> A well-designed website is not a luxury, it's a necessity in today's digital world.

### Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

## Table of Contents

The table of contents is automatically generated based on level 2 (##) headings in your article. Therefore, it's important to use the proper heading hierarchy:

- Level 2 (##) headings for main sections
- Level 3 (###) headings for subsections
- Level 4 (####) headings for further subsections

## Best Practices

### Article Length

Articles should have an appropriate length, typically between 1000 and 2000 words. Articles that are too short may not provide enough value, while those that are too long may discourage readers.

### Article Structure

A well-constructed article should have the following structure:

1. Introduction
2. Summary of main points (SummaryBox)
3. Development of the topic in sections
4. Highlighted important information (WorthKnowingBox)
5. Conclusion
6. Suggestions for further reading (NextArticleBox)

### SEO Optimization

Remember to optimize your article for search engines:

- Use keywords in your article content
- Add alternative descriptions to images
- Use headings to structure your content
- Link to other articles on your site

## Conclusion

This article template shows how to use all available blog components in the NextGen Sites system. By following these guidelines, you can create high-quality content that engages readers and drives traffic to your site.

<WorthKnowingBox>
Remember that the most important thing is the value you provide to your readers. Even the best-formatted article won't be effective if it doesn't contain valuable information.
