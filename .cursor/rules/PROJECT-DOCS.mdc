# Project Documentation Guide

This repository includes several documentation files to help you navigate and understand the project structure. These files are now stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory for better organization.

## Documentation Files

1. **project-index.mdc** - A high-level overview of the project, its dependencies, and best practices.

2. **project-structure.mdc** - Detailed documentation of the project structure, generated automatically.

3. **translation-keys.mdc** - A comprehensive list of translation keys used in the project.

4. **coding-standards.mdc** - Guidelines for code style, patterns, and best practices.

5. **contribution-guide.mdc** - Information about development workflow and process.

6. **deployment.mdc** - Details about deployment processes and environments.

## How to Use

### For Project Overview

Read `project-index.mdc` for a quick understanding of:
- Key technologies used
- Directory structure
- Build commands
- Best practices

### For Detailed Structure

Use `project-structure.mdc` to understand:
- Complete directory tree
- Dependencies
- Key configuration files

### For Translations

Use `translation-keys.mdc` to:
- See all available translations
- Understand the translation key hierarchy
- Learn how to implement translations in different contexts

### For Development

Use `coding-standards.mdc` and `contribution-guide.mdc` to:
- Follow the project's coding standards
- Understand the development workflow
- Learn how to contribute to the project

## File Locations

All documentation files are now stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory:
- `.cursor/rules/PROJECT-DOCS.mdc` (this file)
- `.cursor/rules/project-index.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/translation-keys.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/coding-standards.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/contribution-guide.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/deployment.mdc`

## Regenerating Documentation

To regenerate the documentation, run:

```bash
# Generate project structure documentation
node scripts/index-project.js

# Generate translations documentation
node scripts/index-translations.js
```

Be sure to update the output paths in these scripts to write to the `.cursor/rules` directory.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Documentation Updated** - After making significant changes to the project structure or translations, regenerate the documentation.

2. **Reference Documentation** - When working on the project, refer to these documentation files to understand conventions and patterns.
3. **Send Documentation Links** - When sharing the project with someone new, point them to these documentation files first.
