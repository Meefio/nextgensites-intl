2. **project-structure.mdc** - Detailed documentation of the project structure, generated automatically.

3. **translation-keys.mdc** - A comprehensive list of translation keys used in the project.

4. **coding-standards.mdc** - Guidelines for code style, patterns, and best practices.

5. **contribution-guide.mdc** - Information about development workflow and process.

6. **deployment.mdc** - Details about deployment processes and environments.

7. **blog-guide.mdc** - Guidelines for creating and managing blog posts and knowledge base articles.

## File Locations

All documentation files are now stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory:
- `.cursor/rules/PROJECT-DOCS.mdc` (this file)
- `.cursor/rules/project-index.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/translation-keys.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/coding-standards.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/contribution-guide.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/deployment.mdc`

## Project Structure Updates

The project now includes:
- A knowledge base section (`/baza-wiedzy` for Polish, `/knowledge-base` for English)
- Blog content stored in MDX format in `src/content/blog/[locale]/`
- Internationalized routing defined in `src/i18n/routing.ts`

## Regenerating Documentation

To regenerate the documentation, run:

```bash
# Generate project structure documentation
node scripts/index-project.js

# Generate translations documentation
node scripts/index-translations.js
```

Be sure to update the output paths in these scripts to write to the `.cursor/rules` directory.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Documentation Updated** - After making significant changes to the project structure or translations, regenerate the documentation.

2. **Reference Documentation** - When working on the project, refer to these documentation files to understand conventions and patterns.

3. **Send Documentation Links** - When sharing the project with someone new, point them to these documentation files first.

4. **Update Routing Configuration** - When adding new pages or content, remember to update the internationalization routing in `src/i18n/routing.ts`.
