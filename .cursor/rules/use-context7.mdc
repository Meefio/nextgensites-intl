# Use Context7 MCP for Research

When assisting with this project, follow these steps before making changes or thinking through solutions:

1. **Use Context7 MCP agent** to retrieve relevant documentation for any libraries, frameworks, or technologies involved in the task.

2. Begin by resolving library IDs using `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` for any technology that might be relevant to the current task, including:
   - Next.js
   - React
   - TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS
   - next-intl
   - React Hook Form
   - Zod
   - Radix UI
   - Framer Motion

3. Once you have the library ID, use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` to fetch current documentation.

4. Only after researching the relevant documentation, proceed with analyzing the codebase and proposing solutions.

5. When implementing changes, ensure they align with both the project standards documented in `.cursor/rules/coding-standards.mdc` and the latest best practices from the documentation you retrieved.

6. **Suggest technology improvements**: If you discover newer tools, libraries, or approaches that could significantly improve the project in terms of:
   - Performance
   - Developer experience
   - Maintainability
   - Security
   - User experience
   - Accessibility
   
   Then propose these improvements to the user. Explain the benefits, potential migration effort, and compatibility with the existing codebase.

This approach will ensure that all suggestions and implementations are based on current best practices and accurate documentation for the technologies used in this project.
